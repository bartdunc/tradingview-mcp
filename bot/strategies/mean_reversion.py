"""Mean reversion strategy for range-bound index ETFs (SPY, QQQ).

Fades moves more than `std_dev_threshold` standard deviations from the
rolling mean, expecting a revert; exits once price is back near the mean.

Optional trend filter (`trend_ma_period`): when set, only take reversions that
ALIGN with the longer trend — buy dips only while price is above the trend MA
(an uptrend), sell rips only while below it (a downtrend). This suppresses the
"catching a falling knife" trades — fading a sustained move against you — which
are the dominant loss source when the filter is off.
